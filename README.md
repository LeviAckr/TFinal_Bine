 - An ext that aims to improve the correction performance of your browser due to search and with that a unique supply of ipAdds


## FRRMS

 -  **BineExt is an extension that by itself aims to improve the profitability of your browser's default formatting and search projection, be it chorme, fox, tor, etc. All this through armz.gif[tyip] a relatively unique storage system that allows codes and intelligence to be stored in a small .gif file and as soon as it starts all the code merges the AI ​​and the gif giving a visual minimalist and clean interface, much more than that bine also for only itself uses its own conserved network system so that it can provide you with a single authenticity per ip, summarizing: the formatting is increased by 60% (browsers default ) to about 90%. Bine is certainly made for developers and those with console and logging skills, but beyond that bine always aims to innovate with a simple look.**
